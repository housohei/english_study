Captain Ben has bought an unusual 'taxi' and has begun a new service.
The 'Taxi' is a small Swiss aeroplane called a 'Peter'.
The wonderful plane can carry seven passengers.
The most surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: on snow, water, or even on a ploughed field.
The first passenger of captain Ben was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village at Welsh.
Captain Ben's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains. 
Since then, Captain Ben has flown passengers to many unusual places. 
Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a desert car park.
Captain Ben has just refused a stranger request from a businessman.
The man wanted to fly to Carol, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Ben didn't take him because the trip was too dangerous.
