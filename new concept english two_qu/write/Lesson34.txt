Dan has been worried all week.
Last Tuesday he received a letter from the local police.
In the letter he was asked to call at the station.
Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police,
but yesterday he went to the station and now he is not worried anymore.
At the station, he was told by a smiling police that his bicycle had been found.
Five days ago, the policeman told him, the bicycle was picked up in a small village 400 miles away.
It is now being sent to him home by train.
When he heard the news, Dan was most surprised. 
He was amused too because he has never expected the bicycle to be found.
It was stolen 20 years ago when dan was a boy of fifteen.
