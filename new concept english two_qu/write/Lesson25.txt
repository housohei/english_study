I arrived in London at last. 
The railway station was big, black and dark.
I didn't know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter.
I spoke English not only very carefully, but very clearly as well.
The porter, however, could not understand me.
I repeated my question sever times and he at last understood.
He answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly.
"I am a foreigner," I said.
Then he spoke slowly, but I couldn't understand him.
My teacher never spoke English like that!
The porter and I looked at each other and smiled.
Then he said something and I understood it.
"You will soon learn English!" he said.
I wondered.
In England, each person speaks a different language.
The English understand each other, but I don't understand them.
Do they speak English?
