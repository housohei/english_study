//目的的几种表达方法
//第一类：
to do ...
in order to do...
so as to do...
//注意事项
1. //不定式的主语需和句子主语保持一致
I have to get up early to catch the flight.
2. //表示“为了不”多用 so not to do 或 in order not to do, 很少用not to do
I have to get up early so as not to miss the flight.
3. //若前后主语不一致，则用for sb. to do...
He bought a toy for his son to play with.

//第二类
so that...
in order that...
//用从句时两个主语一致不一致均可，但从句中需有can, could, will, would, might, should等情态动词
I have to get up early so that I can/will catch the flight.
He bought a toy so that his son could play with it.
//从句为否定句时多用should
He looked down so that / in order that she should not see his eyes.

//目的部分在句中作表语时用to do.
