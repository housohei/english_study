动词不定式
1.不定式在句子中可作主语，表语，宾语，和补语等
1）作主语
To see is to believe.
当代英语常用it作为语法上的主语，即形式主语，将真实主语（不定式）放在主语之后。
It always pays to tell the truth. //说实话总不会吃亏
2）作表语
Your task is to look after the baby. //你的任务是照顾这个小孩
3）作宾语
They want to learn English.
有许多动词可以带名词、代词然后再跟不定式，即动词+名词/代词+to...
I want you to help me.
Tell them to carry the box.
2.动词不定式的否定形式是在to之前加not
He dicided not to tell his mother.
My mother told me not to close the door.
3.to 是小品词，后面接动词原形；to是介词则后面接名词，代词或动名词。
My mother asked me to air the room. //to 小品词
I am linstening to the radio. //to 介词
4.有些动词如hear,see,make,let等后面是加不带to的不定式
