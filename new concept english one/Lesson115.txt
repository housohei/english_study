//不定代词
一，不定代词有三种，普通不定代词、个体不定代词、数量代词
1，普通补丁代词
1）some/any/no
2）somebody/anybody/nobody/
   someone/anyone/no one
   something/anything/nothing
3）one/none
2，个体代词
1）all/every/each/other/another/either/neither/both/half
2）everybody/everyone/everything
3 数量代词
  many/much/few/little/a few/a little/a lot of/lots of

二，不定代词一般既可以指认也可以指物，
    但其中有 -body和-none构成的符合代词只能指认，
	由-ing构成的复合代词及修饰不可数名词的much和little 只能指物

三，大多数不定代词都可以代替名词或形容词，在句中作主语，宾语，定语和表语
1）no，every 只能有形容词功能，作定语；
2）none，others及所有的合成代词只有名词功能不能作定语；
3）all，both，each 还可以作同位语

A.作主语
Everyone is out.
Everyone is ready.
Nobody tells me about it.
B.作宾语
I've got nothing to eat.
I've seen nothing.
I saw no none.
C.作表语
There's nothing on the shelf.
There's somebody in the room. //房间里有人
That's nothing.

与some和any的用法一样
1）somebody/something/somewhere 一般用于肯定句
2）anybody/anyone/anything/anywhere 用于疑问句与否定句
3）nothing/nobody/no one/nowhere相当于
   not anything/anybody/anyone/anywhere

Someone is asking to see you.
I went nowhere = I didn't go anywhere.
I saw no one = I didn't see anyone.

Everything can be done has been done. //所有可以做的事情已经做完了
