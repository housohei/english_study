/** 情态动词must和need **/
1.must
1)表示"必须"或"应该"做某事
We must do everything step by step.
You mustn't talk like that.
2)在回答由must引起的问题时，如果是否定的答复，不能用mustn't,而需用needn't或don't have ot ,
因为musn't是"一定不要"，"不准"的意思
needn't        //没有必要
don't have to  //没有必要
mustn't        //千万不要，不准
Must we send in our plan this week?
-yes, you must.
-No, you needn't.
3)must与have to 的最大区别在于
当表示过去某时不得不做完了某事，只能用had to do sth.
I did not go to see you this morning because I had to go to the hospital.

2.need
1)作情态动词，表示"需要",主要用于否定句及疑问句，肯定句用
must, have to, should, ought to

//在有否定意思的句子(no,hardly等否定词的句子)中也可以用情态动词need

//do not need to 更加正式一些，在口语中用needn't时更多一些

He needn't be told. //无需告诉他 --告诉他没有好处或没用
