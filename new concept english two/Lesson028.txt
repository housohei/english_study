/** 定语从句 **/
一、在主从复合句中，充当主句某一成分（主语，宾语，表语，状语）的定语的主谓结构叫定语从句
二、定语从句一般由关系代词(who, that, which, whose, whom)或关系副词(when, where, why) 引导的
Do you know the man who came to see Xiao Yang this morning?
At the time when I saw him, he was well.
三、定语从句分为限定性定语从句和非限定性定语从句
1、限定性定语从句修饰的次代表一个或一类特定的人或东西，如果拿掉了定语从句，剩下的部分就会失去意义，不能成立或意思不清楚或不能说明问题
Those who want to go please sign their names here.
The letter that I received from him yesterday is very important.
The students who went to see the film were very disappointed. 
2、非限定性定语从句，只对所修饰的词作进一步说明，拿掉之后其他部分仍可成立
//非限定性定语从句通常用逗号隔开
She was very fond of speaking French, which indeed she spoke well.
I have many friends, some of whom are painters.
3、限定性定语从句
1）如果修饰人，一般用关系代词who或that，做主语时用who较多，且不可省略，如果关系代词在从句中做宾语，用宾格whom或that，在口语中可用who代替，但在大多数情况下都可以省略
The people who/that/whom/- you were talking to where Swedes.
He is a man who/that/whom/- you can safely depend on.
Here is the man who/that/whom/- you've been looking for.
2）在表示"...的"这个所有关系的时候，可以用它的所有格whose。
Is there anyone in your class whose family is in the northeast? //你们班有家在东北的人吗?
3）限定性定语从句如果修改时"物"，用关系代词that或which(但在从句中做主语时不可省略)
The parcel that/which came just now was for Tom.
The train that/which has just left if for Xi'an.
3）当这个代词在从句中做宾语时，大多数情况下可以省略，尤其在口语中
Is there anything you need?
4）在介词后只能用which
The tool with which he is working is called a wrench.
=The tool that he is working with is called a wrench.
5）当限定性定语从句修饰一个时间的时候，常用关系副词when来引导定语从句，在很多情况下还可以不用或用that来表达
There are moments when I forget all about it. //总有一天我会忘记这些事情的
Come any time that you like. //你随时都可以来
She made me feel at home the moment I arrived. //我一到这里她就让我感觉像到家里一样
6）限定性定语从句在修饰表示地点的名词前用关系副词where，在从句中充当状语成分
I know a place where we can swim.
Is there a shop around where we can get fruit? //附近有没有我们可以买到水果的商店
7）在reason后的定语从句可由why引导，why也可常省略
This is the reason (why) I did it.
8）在way后也可以跟定语从句，不需关系代词或副词 --way 方式，方法
That's the way I look at it. //那就是我看待它的方法
That was the way she looked after us. //那就是她照顾我们的方式

believe in //信仰，信奉
